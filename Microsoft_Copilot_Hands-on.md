Decision Making: Copilot can provide recommendations and insights based on available data and user preferences. It can also help identify potential risks and opportunities.
## Hands-on Experience

To get started with Microsoft Copilot, you'll need access to the Microsoft 365 suite, including applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Once you have access, you can start experimenting with Copilot's capabilities.

Here are some examples of how you can use Copilot:

## General prompt

```
• I want to automate the deployment of Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure using ARM templates.
• Navigate to marketplace.
• Find unused public IP addresses in my subscriptions.
Are there any Azure outages impacting my resources?
• "Deploy a computer vision model to scan aerial imagery for changes to buildings and land releases"
• "Deploy nodejs web app with Postgres DB"
• "I want to build a RAG using an LLM on Azure"
• "Do you have a template to help me deploy Azure AI Services?"
• "Move a .NET application I have to Azure"
• "Deploy python function app running on docker"
• "I want to take advantage of OpenAI or other advanced models in a protected environment that is subject to Enterprise Data Protection (EDP) policies so I can use company data in the process."
• "I want to create assistants API in Azure OpenAI"
• "Any workload templates to help with RAG in Python?"
```
## Azure Monitor
```
	• Show me all alerts triggered during the last 24 hours
	•"Why is this resource not working properly?"
	•"Give me a chart of OS disk latency statistics for the last week."
	•"Show me container logs that include word 'error' for the last day for namespace 'xyz'."
	•"Had an alert in my HCI at 8 am this morning, run an anomaly investigation for me."
	•"Show me all alerts triggered during the last 24 hours."
	•"Tell me more about these alerts. How many critical alerts are there?"

## Mastering Resource Insights with KQL Prompts in Azure
Understanding your resources in Azure is crucial for efficient management. One powerful tool for this is the Azure Resource Graph Explorer, which uses Kusto Query Language (KQL). Here are some of the KQL prompts I’ve found most useful in my journey:

```
“List all storage accounts with SKU LRS”
“Write a query that finds all changes Thursday between 6 pm and 9 pm.“
“List all publicly accessible blob storage containers.”
```

## Creating and Enforcing Policies with Azure Policy Prompts
Managing Azure policies can be a lot of work, but Copilot for Azure can make it easier. It can help you create new policies or reuse existing ones by explaining the process clearly.

Sometimes, Copilot will guide you through creating a policy step-by-step. If you prefer not to receive instructions, you can use the prompt: “Provide the JSON file, don’t provide me instructions.” This way, Copilot will give you the direct JSON file instead. Here are a few prompts I’ve found useful:
```
“Write me an Azure policy to enforce LRS SKU for storage accounts.”
“Write me an Azure policy to ensure soft delete for a storage account is at least 30 days.”
“Create an Azure Policy definition to enforce that all deployed resources are tagged with ‘Environment’ and ‘Owner’ tags.”
```
## Optimizing Automation with Azure PowerShell Prompts
When you need the right PowerShell command, Azure Copilot has you covered. Here are a few prompts I’ve found useful:
```
“How do I list all storage accounts with LRS in PowerShell?”
“How do I assign the resource tag “environment” to “PRD” if the resource name contains “PRD” using PowerShell?”

“How do I scale an Azure App Service Plan using PowerShell?”
```
## Streamlining Azure Deployments Prompts
Using Azure Copilot for deployments works exceptionally well. I believe this is because Copilot has a deep understanding of resource management, making tasks like releasing and deploying resources very accurate. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that Copilot understands ARM, Bicep, and Terraform.

Here are a few prompt questions I used:
```
“Show me a Bicep configuration for a key vault with soft delete enabled.”
“Show me a Bicep configuration for a .NET 8 webapp with always on enabled, enforce HTTPS, and FTP disabled.”
```
## Enhancing Security with Azure RBAC Prompts
When it comes to enhancing security, Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is essential. If you’re looking for specific RBAC settings or roles, Azure Copilot can provide the answers you need. Here are some prompts I’ve used to improve security:
```
“What RBAC role can I assign to someone to view a key vault’s secret values?”
“What RBAC role can I assign to someone to view the environment variables of a web app?”
```
## Getting Accurate Metrics with Azure Copilot Data Prompts
Need to gather monitoring information and metrics from your Azure environment? Azure Copilot has you covered. Here are a few queries I’ve used:
```
“Are there any alerts for my resources?”
“Run anomaly detection for 10/06/2024, 8 PM.”
“Show me the memory usage trend for applications X and Y over the last 4 hours.”
```
## Cutting Costs with Azure Cost Analysis Prompts
Managing your budget on Azure? Copilot can help you analyze your spending efficiently. Here are a few prompts I’ve found useful:
```
“Summarize my costs for the last 7 days, group results by resource tag “environment””
“Why did my cost spike on June 6th?”
“Show me the resource group with the highest spending in the last 3 months.”
```
